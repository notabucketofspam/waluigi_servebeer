<q>Y'know, I gotta tell ya, I gotta say that I'm enjoying adulthood for a lot of reasons,
and I'll tell ya reason number one. As an adult, if I want cookie, I have a cookie, ok?
[laughter] I have three cookies, or four cookies, or eleven cookies, if I want.
[laughter] Many times I will intentionally <i>ruin</i> my entire appetite.
[laughter] Just ruin it! And then I call my mother up right afterwards to tell her that I did it.
[laughter] "Hello mom, yeah, I just ruined my entire appetite. Cookies."
So what if you ruin it? See, because, as an adult, we understand,
even if you ruin an appetite, there's another appetite coming right behind it.
[laughter] There's no danger in running out of appetites.
[laughter] I've got millions of 'em, I ruin 'em whenever i <i>want></i>.</q>
&horbar; Jerry Seinfeld, on cookies

What's the deal with cookie banners, anyways? You go to one site, you click
the little "ok" button, then you go to another site and there's a
<i>second</i> little "ok" button waiting for you there, too.
