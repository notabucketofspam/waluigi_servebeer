        We know the story. You've tried it all...
        <ul>
          <li>Coal fresh from the ground.</li>
          <li>Coal stuffed in wooden crates.</li>
          <li>Coal straight off the belts.</li>
          <li>You've even tried solid fuel just to see what it was like.</li>
        </ul>
        But none of them were ever enough.
      </p>
      <p style="font-size: 130%;">
        Well have we got The Answer for you!
      </p>
      <p style="font-size: 130%;">
        <b>Introducing New Coal!</b>
      </p>
      <p style="font-size: 110%;">
        That's right, New Coal. <br>
        New Coal. <br>
        It's Coal that's New! <br>
      </p>
      <p>
        Now you may be asking yourself: "Hey, what's the deal with New Coal?"
        Well, I'll tell you what's the deal with New Coal.
        It's exactly what it sounds like. You know how Classic Coal is made out 
        of Old Stuff<sup>&#8482;</sup>? It's just trees and fish that have long 
        since expired and been compressed like some kind of ancient JPEG. That's
        sort of gross if you ask me. There's got to be a better answer. Surely
        we can find a way to enjoy the high-quality flavor of coal without having
        to deal with all that Nasty Business<sup>&#8482;</sup>. 
        This is where New Coal comes in. Using our proprietary Air Filter 
        technology, we're able to extract carbon right out of the atmosphere of
        your filthy factory and transform it into an edible product. As an added 
        bonus, the manufacturing process cleans up your excessive pollution, so 
        you don't even have to worry anymore about those damn bugs trying to bust down
        your wall to steal this synthetic delicacy.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's got that rich bitter taste we all know and love. It's got that deep
        crunch you've come to expect. It's got that complex amorphous texture in 
        every mouthful. It's New Coal.
      </p>
