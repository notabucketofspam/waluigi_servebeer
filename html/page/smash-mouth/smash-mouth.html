        somebody once told me the world was gonna roll me i ain't the sharpest tool
        in the shed she was lookin' kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb in
        the shape of an l on her forehead well the years start coming and they
        don't stop coming fed to the rules and you hit the ground running didn't
        make sense not to live for fun your brain gets smart but your head get's dumb
        so much to do so much to see so what's wrong with taking the back seat you
        never know if you don't go you never shine if you don't glow hey now you're
        a all star get your game on go play hey now you're a rockstar get the show
        on get paid and all that glitters is gold and only shooting stars breaks the
        mold

        hey so you wanna play you see my game's on fire but we don't play the
        same game you'll see i'm greedy for speed and neutral means nothing to
        me so if that's your desire we'll get along famously but one thing i
        like to lead i light 'em up before the motor starts i go so fast i
        could never stop look under the hood but you don't know what i got i'm
        a moving violation baby hot hot hot hot

        it ain't no joke i'd like to send the boss a note and teach our work to pick
        the perfect employee and teach it to stop the dials starting fires and i
        know it's just a page but it's hard for the machine don't cut them any slack
        brother went out but they're back they're just like any tech they neglect on
        their contracts and just like modems there's no slowdowns for that
        telephone shtick if you've got the files come and send 'em' i need them real
        quick so don't delay but now papers are running out allow the sheets to
        arrive if the line's still alive if you don't invest they may come
        pre-compressed but if that machine is done you might as well be faxin' on
        the sun
