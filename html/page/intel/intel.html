          <li>
            Intel soon to enter the kitchen appliance business (we already got 
            the <b>toaster</b> manufacturing part figured out with Netburst)
          </li>
          <li>
            Upcoming: i9 not enough for you? Turn it up to eleven with <b>i11</b>, featuring 
            11 cores and 23.5 threads. Why eleven you may ask? Well Nvidia got away 
            with this BS for the 1080ti VRAM so we thought we'd try our luck lol.
          </li>
          <li>
            Also: i3 too much for you? Introducing the <b>Core i1</b>, equipped with
            two-thirds of a core and like maybe a single thread if you're lucky.
          </li>
          <li>
            The new <b>Intel GPU</b> has been delayed again, but that shouldn't surprise
            anyone at this point.

        <span class="f5">PENTIUM D 420XX</span>
        <hr>
        <p>
          Do computer stuff like never before. With the latest lineup of Pentiums,
          anything is possible. From gaming to modeling to crunching a lot of 
          numbers in Excel to whatever else's hip with the kids these days, you'll
          be amazed by how quick the things go.
          It's packing like a half-dozen cores too so you can multitask the hell
          outta your workflow.
          Built on Nephalem for that nostalgic Core gen-one feeling, but with our 
          snazzy 14nm+++++ fab process so it boosts up to like five or six
          gigahertz, my dude. TDP is a hundred something Watts but who cares.

          <b>Interview: </b> Big John talks about LGA 2069
        </span>
        <blockquote>
          Aight so here's the deal. We got over two thousand pins on these fancy-shmancy 
          motherboards, right? Well we thought "Hey what if we made that over two
          thousand plus three." And that's where LGA 2069 comes in. It's 
          fundamentally the exact same product as 2066 except now it's completely
          incompatible with existing hardware. That means that all the datacenters
          and HEDT users gotta fork over their lunch money again if they want to 
          stay in the with it and hip crowd. Futureproofing is dead and we have 
          killed it.
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          Now we just gotta hope that the damn Chinese don't come up with a 
          backwards-compatibility hack again like they did with LGA 771...

          <b>Intel Compute Stick 2: </b>the sequel everyone's been asking for
        </span>
        <p style="margin-left:40px">
          Using just one HDMI port is so pass&eacute;. This time we've got two of them,
          one on each end of the stick, to double the bandwidth for 
          that quality 8k experience. We've also added USB-C connectors on the top 
          and bottom so you can plug one stick into another, creating an 
          infinitely chainable source of computing power. That's right, you can
          now make a fully functional compute cluster out of single-core Atom
          processors. Think of how many screens you could power with this sort of 
          advanced tech!
