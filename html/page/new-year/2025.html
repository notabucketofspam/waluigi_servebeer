<p class="f1">We know the story. You've tried it all...</p>

<ul>
  <li>Year fresh from the ground.</li>
  <li>Year stuffed in cat calendars.</li>
  <li>Year straight off your phone.</li>
  <li>You've even tried <img style="display:inline-block;height:0.75lh;" src="/page/new-year/lizard_time.jpg" /> lizard time just to see what it was like.</li>
</ul>

<p>But none of them were ever enough.</p>

<p class="f3">Well have we got The Answer for you!</p>

<p class="f3"><b>Introducing New Year!</b></p>

<div class="f1">That's right, New Year.</div>
<div class="f1">New Year.</div>
<div class="f1">It's Year that's New!</div>

<p>Now you may be asking yourself: "Hey, what's the deal with New Year?" Well, I'll tell you what's the deal with New Year. It's exactly what it sounds like. You know how Classic Year is made out of Old Stuff<sup>&#8482;</sup>? It's just memes and copypastas that have long since expired and been compressed like some kind of ancient JPEG. That's sort of gross if you ask me. There's got to be a better answer. Surely we can find a way to enjoy the high-quality passage of time without having to deal with all that Nasty Business<sup>&#8482;</sup>. This is where New Year comes in. Using our proprietary Chat Filter technology, we're able to extract content right out of the atmosphere of your filthy Discord server and transform it into a memeable product. As an added bonus, the aging process mops up your excessive braincells, so you don't even have to worry anymore about those damn bots trying to raid your channel to steal this aesthetic delicacy.</p>

<p style="letter-spacing:-0.1px;">It's got that rich free-time waste we all know and love. It's got that sleep crunch you've come to expect. It's got that complex amorphous conjecture in every monthful. It's New Year.</p>

<p class="f3"><b>Your hyper-temporal hellscape just got a whole lot lazier.</b></p>
