<p>Aight, listen up. So here's the whatever:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <b>Waluigi is my uncle.</b> He is not "a Nintendo character" or whatever. Any resemblance to persons, real or fake, Nintendo or otherwise, is purely coincidental and, yes, you <em>are</em> imagining things.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Not all men named Waluigi are from "Nintendo" or whatever.</b> I will have you know that my very real uncle Waluigi (<em>very real</em>) does, in fact, serve very real beer in the real world (<em>very real</em> beer; real-ness of world still TBD).
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>You can't sue me just because you're imagining things.</b> Delusion is not a strong basis for a lawsuit. Waluigi himself told me so one time (albeit this was after he'd served us both some <em>very</em> real beers (<em class="spacey">very real</em>)).
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>By using this website, you agree to the whatever.</b> So like yeah.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>Now it's your turn:</p>
