So alotta people have been wondering: ...
</p><p>
      "who has the <em>best</em> meats?"
</p><p class="m">
And with that said, let's dive into it.</p>
<p class="l">
<u>Meat #1: Arby's</u></p><p>
    Your local Arby's has meat; everybody knows this. But is it <em>worth your time?</em>
</p><p>
    Answer: maybe. Arby's hasn't substantially innovated in the Meat Climate in over seven (7) years. If you're a
    pedestrian who <i class="spacey">enjoys</i> the taste of un-innovated meats, then, <i>yes</i>, Arby's is <em>worth
    your time</em>. But that doesn't mean that you <i>should</i> settle for such un-innovated meats. Meat is evolving,
    and so can you.</p>
<p class="l">
<u>Meat #2: Deer Slabs</u></p><p>
    You can craft deer slabs using slabs of deer meat, a cooking station, and an open flame (in that order).
</p><p>
<b>Deer are a menace</b> to all local flora, <i>especially</i> those that are short (&lt;6'4" tall).
</p><p>
    <em>Every deer killed is another shrub saved.</em>
</p><p>
    Do your civic duty; eat a deer slab.</p>
<p class="l">
<u>Meat #3: Wolf Jerkey&#8482;</u></p><p>
    I think that Wolf Jerkey&#8482; is pretty good. And I'm not just saying that.
</p><p>
    What makes Wolf Jerkey&#8482; special is the ingredients. Wolf Jerkey&#8482; is made
    with 100% Real Wolf Meat&#8482; and 100% Real Honey&#8482;.
</p><p>
    That's what makes Wolf Jerkey&#8482; special. Preorders available now.
</p><p class="l">
<u>Meat #4: Arby's at 2AM</u></p><p>
    Your local Arby's is probably not open at 2AM; everybody knows this. But is it <em>worth your time?</em>
</p><p>
    Answer: <i>yes</i>, absolutely. Even though Arby's-class meat is un-innovated, some meat enthusiasts have found
    a novel way to preserve their Arby's meats via an in-home refridgeration system. Innovation, when rendered
    as a coefficient of meat, is a real-valued function of time; accordingly, Arby's-class meat improves across all
    metrics as the delta widens between "time that the meat was purchased" and "time that the meat was consumed." Your
    local Arby's may lock their buy menu at a set time each night, so purchases should be planned accordingly.
    </p><p>
&#32;   <b>&#9888;WARNING&#9888;</b> <i>No</i> meat, Arby's-class or elsewise, may be left unattended in
    an environment with an ambient atmospheric temperature in excess of 41&deg;F (5&deg;C). To do so
    is to invite the growth of <i class="spacey">microorganisms</i> in, on, and around the meat.
    </p><p>
    Additionally, <i>any</i> meat's quality is time-variant, and steadily decreases at an
    approximately-linear rate while in preservation; the exact function may depend on
    the particular meat's substrate class, among other factors.
</p><p class="l">
<u>Meat #5: Impossible Whopper</u></p><p>
    jk lol
</p><p class="l">
<u>Meat #6: Apple Silicon A18 Pro chip</u></p><p>
    Now I <i>know</i> what you must be thinking at this point. "Hey," you mumble, your words barely audible through
    a mouthful of Wolf Jerkey&#8482;, "Apple is a fruit."
</p><p>
    Yes, dear pedestrian, Apple is a fruit.<br>
