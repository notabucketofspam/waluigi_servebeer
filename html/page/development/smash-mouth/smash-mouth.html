    same game you'll see i'm greedy for speed and neutral means nothing to 
    me so if that's your desire we'll get along famously but one thing i 
    like to lead i light 'em up before the motor starts i go so fast i 
    could never stop look under the hood but you don't know what i got i'm 
    a moving violation baby hot hot hot hot

    somebody once told me the world was gonna roll me i ain't the sharpest tool 
    in the shed she was lookin' kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb in 
    the shape of an l on her forehead well the years start coming and they 
    don't stop coming fed to the rules and you hit the ground running didn't 
    make sense not to live for fun your brain gets smart but your head get's dumb 
    so much to do so much to see so what's wrong with taking the back seat you 
    never know if you don't go you never shine if you don't glow hey now you're 
    a all star get your game on go play hey now you're a rockstar get the show 
    on get paid and all that glitters is gold and only shooting stars breaks the 
    mold

    it ain't no joke i'd like to send the boss a note and teach our work to pick 
    the perfect employee and teach it to stop the dials starting fires and i

    brother went out but they're back they're just like any tech they neglect on 
    their contracts and just like modems there's no slowdowns for that 
    telephone shtick if you've got the files come and send 'em' i need them real 
    quick so don't delay but now papers are running out allow the sheets to 
    arrive if the line's still alive if you don't invest they may come 
    pre-compressed but if that machine is done you might as well be faxin' on 
    the sun
